i wrote a long letter to her .
the factory did not want him .
your work didn 't come up to our expectations .
where can i see a football game ?

it was yesterday morning that i saw mr carter .

the town was exactly the same as before .
it is likely that he did it on purpose .
your new dress becomes you very well .
i 'd like a money order for ten dollars .

he came back soon .
the climate here doesn 't agree with me .
what do you do in japan ?
he looks older than my brother .
he looked after the baby .
it 's bad luck to say that .

he is a fast runner .
i accompanied her on the piano .

though he is wealthy he is not happy .
our teacher looks young for her age .
his answer is to the point .
here 's my receipt .
he stood up slowly .
he likes coffee without sugar .
how much money does he possess ?
and then he sat down himself .
is your father a teacher ?
he is the right man for the job .
it 's expensive though .
what shall we eat tonight ?
i haven 't eaten lunch yet .
it is true that he is ill .
my father has visited london many times .
he will come down soon .
say ' ahhh ' .
i got up at seven this morning .
please show me the way to the station .
he is all but dead .
did you get good marks ?
she was always practicing the piano .
do you think we can get there in time ?
you told him that he should have a reward .
i wrote a letter last night .
stop making a fool of yourself .
take care not to catch cold .
i don 't know what to do .
be on your guard against fire .
tomorrow let 's go to the morning bazaar .
is it necessary for me to explain the reason to him ?
i 'm tied up with this job recently .
i 'd like to know the exact time .
he broke off talking because of the sudden noise .
so what ? it doesn 't matter to me .
we 've got to shake him up .
you look upon my idea as being behind the times .
i have made a prize mistake .
the lake is deepest here .
you had better have your hair cut .
he cannot be a poet .
he is always reading .
we hope to meet you again .
he was agitated by the news .
the movie starts at ten o 'clock .
there is nothing like sleep .
you must study much harder .
don 't turn off the light .
i feel a strong attachment to this house .
he is regretful that he couldn 't go .
to my astonishment , my money was gone .
how about next saturday ?
the government makes us pay tax .
we stand against free trade .
you may as well keep it a secret .
would you care for more cookies ?
she fell in love with him at first sight .
it is a good plan but hard to carry out .
swimming at night is dangerous .
you have not eaten the cake yet .
she has a bath every morning .
the other day i met an old friend on the street .
that 's bill all over .
as i was ill , i couldn 't go to the meeting .
these shoes are too expensive .
look , someone is calling you .
i 've decided not to keep a dog again .
he acted on the matter .
i 'd like to reserve a table for two .
as often as she tried , she failed .
there is yet time .
he is taken care of by his uncle .
how much would you want to pay for the tour ?
he must have been home then .
i see the point of the argument .
we were late , owing to the heavy snow .
i 'll call again later .
i can 't get sexual satisfaction .
my father will be forty-five in may .
he had to leave the village .
don 't talk nonsense !
he is leaving home now .
you cannot expect much of him .
this park reminds me of my childhood .
there is a car in front of the building .
how are you getting along these days ?
i can 't remember how to go there .
is this your copy of the dictionary ?
i regret that i can 't come today .
it is true that the earth is round .
please don 't leave valuable things here .
whichever road you may take , it will lead to the station .
i can 't sleep at all !
what are the measures of times ?
where are you planning to stay ?
she is by no means angelic .
the sun doesn 't shine at night .
that 's easy for you to say .
i would sooner stay than go .
great was the sorrow of her parents .
i must call him sometimes during the morning .
his speech inspired all the boys .
i don 't believe him any longer .
we always looked down on him .
would you just move along a bit , please ?
he showed me her picture .
i will give him another chance .
she worked hard , only to fail the examination .
the time has come when we must part .
he is passive in everything .
what do you learn at school ?
i wish something nice would happen .
friends should help one another .
i want to study abroad .
she failed to keep her promise .
i 'm very happy that i can take care of the baby .
i think i 'm just tired .
there is not a scrap of truth in his words .
this book is less large than that one .
would you care for some more cake ?
do you know who took the call ?
lend me a hand .
the woods are my home .
i don 't know how much this motorcycle is .
there are some boys under the tree .
don 't show them your hand .
i would play tennis with him on sunday .
please phone me before you come .
she may be french .
let 's enjoy the long vacation .
i 'll get in touch with you as soon as i return from america .
i have nothing more to say .
it 's all up with me .
we went to the park to play .
sorry . traffic was heavy .
this will be his car .
she sang with a beautiful voice .
that music really gets me .
he was so kind as to give the old man his seat .
we got angry at his words .
her house is very modern .
i will never fall in love again .
she will attend the meeting instead of me .
did he tell you anything ?
he works hard so that he can study abroad .
clear one 's throat .
this is how the accident happened .
might i ask your address ?
i found it easy to speak english .
he can run the fastest in his class .
this bike is used by my brother .
my pen is old . i want a new one .
father is busy , so i will go instead .
a boy is walking across the street .
he left three days ago .
it matters little where he is from .
i had intended to visit you yesterday .
do you have hot towels ?
i 'm working for mcdonald 's .
what is he up to ?
when he writes english , he often consults the dictionary .
this is a mountain famous for its scenery .
he tried to be less obtrusive .
you can stay as long as you like .
my guess is that it will be fine tomorrow .
he is an agreeable person .
i really like city life .
he is looking for a job .
i 'm sorry , i don 't have smaller change .
it 's strange you say that .
i really understand what you mean .
how old is your father ?
shall i carry your bag ?
he 's a pushover .
both tom and bill are playing tennis now .
how fast does he run ?
we have had a lot of snow and i am very happy .
she didn 't marry the man .
i 'm not available right now .
all of the students were present .
do you mind turning on the tv ?
what a beautiful sunset .
all are welcome .
these flowers are dying .
come and have tea with me .
it was here that i saw her .
how are relations between the two of them going ?
my uncle has a farm in the village .
may i have your name and telephone number , please ?
the fact is known to everybody .
this bicycle needs repairing .
i am looking for an assistant .
i think that he is in the right in this dispute .
what had kept him from coming to the party ?
could i get a japanese newspaper , please ?
i agree with you to a certain extent .
you ought to see a doctor .
bring it to me .
did you see a doctor ?
we still have enough time to discuss it .
where can we exchange yen into dollars ?
he reproached me for carelessness .
don 't let anyone come near the fire .
i have been in paris .
what is it that you really want to say ?
i do not have to study japanese .
i don 't think so .
where do i get stamps ?
have you been to kyoto ?
does she work in this city ?
she always keeps her room in good order .
he concealed the fact from me .
her older sister got married last month .
the girl can 't have done such a thing .
his speech continued for three hours .
your party doesn 't answer .
are you going to have dinner at home ?
she takes after her mother in looks .
this is the surest way to succeed .
he opened the door .
he fell down on the floor .
get your carcass out of here !
will you please shut the door ?
she shouted at the top of her voice .
she came down to breakfast at eight .
you must clean your room every day .
she begged him to send her home .
this table is reserved .
i 'm afraid he 's just gone out .
she was on the verge of crying .
remember to post the letter .
he has been to switzerland before .
work is behind schedule .
tell me the story .
there are a great many people in the park .
if you care to come , you will be welcome .
you should always think before you speak .
he left after he had lunch .
the boy looked into the room .
that 's the cause of his failure .
tommy , can you hear me ?
they will get married in due course .
the police released him .
you had better get up early .
what 's up ?
let 's go and see as many things as we can .
make sure you have reserved a room at the hotel .
he did his best only to fail again .
please see my people .
did he tell you the truth ?
young as he is , he has much experience .
he hasn 't answered my letter yet .
she is always free in the afternoon .
we told a lie to him , and hurt him .
come on in and make yourself at home .
i am much obliged to you for your kindness .
what on earth are you doing in my room ?
her ability took her to the top .
i spent a week at my uncle 's .
i was in trouble with the police last night .
i had my wife die .
there was a fine scent in the room .
i 'd better be on my way .
they have left school now .
we should be headed for world peace .
she 's good at getting around rules .
i have little interest in history .
may i show you around ?
this a recent photo ?
they love each other .
can you hold on a little longer ?
this medicine will take the pain away .
we had terrible times during the war .
he tried opening the door .
tom doesn 't run as fast as bill .
she has been watching television for three hours .
i was given a camera by my uncle .
she waved her hand to us .
this is too good to be true .
i 'm all in .
when will he be busy ?
turn off the light before you go to bed .
have you heard about the result of the game ?
it snowed for many days together .
the post office is just across from the store .
you lied to me , didn 't you ?
here comes the train .
he has been sick for a long time .
the gates of the school open at eight .
we played around the farm .
you are very early this morning .
he 's out of town on business .
land came in sight .
they won the day .
i 've got a lot of things to do this week .
they drive on the left in england .

except for one person , everybody went home .
i cannot put up with his idleness any longer .
i was just about to leave the house when the telephone rang .
it is time for us to go home .
how do you go to school ?
take your father a cup of coffee .
there is your bag .
no one has failed .
the music carried me back to my childhood .
it was so noisy that i couldn 't make myself heard .
that 's just what i was going to say .
with all her faults , i still like her .
what is the exact time ?
he is known to all the people in the town .

i failed to put film in my camera .
the door is sometimes open .
the tired boy is fast asleep .
take this medicine when you have a cold .
let 's drop the subject .

wherever you say .
we called on his aid .
i have no particular reason to do so .
what do you call this bird ?
every child bowed to the teacher .
he is good at playing tennis .
i got up early yesterday .
he came running .
we had a secret meeting .
turn off the gas .

we have known each other for many years now .
i like coffee very much .
the computer 's color is red .
it is cloudy today .
we were astonished at the news .
do you think her attractive ?
he is very close with his money .
how fast he runs !
somehow or other i found his house .
don 't ask .
she sometimes has her mother cut her hair .
suddenly , a good idea occurred to me .
they were afraid of the big dog .
he asked her advice about the problem .
the men were carrying the boy to the hospital .
he got the money from her by a trick .
won 't you come to my house next sunday ?
i booked through to paris .
i tried to get down every word he said .
he bought it for five dollars .
i put my watch in for repair .
old mr smith is saving as much money as he can .
he has been in japan for three years .

she played a tune on the piano .
he is very honest in business .

you only have to work hard .
i have breakfast at seven every morning .
walk faster so as not to fall behind .
what are the dimensions of the room ?
please tell me what happened to him .
he got sick during the trip .
i will bear your words in mind .
i 'm afraid you have the wrong number .
our teacher made us clean the room .
suffice it to say that , after all , this won 't do .
he had to think for himself .
we used to talk over a cup of coffee .
we were able to catch the last train .
i 'm dead against the plan .
most boys like computer games .
he is now on the way to recovery .
he speaks french .
they have access to the library .
the idea is very attractive .
you may take either half of the cake .
i am talking with tom .
he didn 't die in vain .
i went to bed a little later than usual .
today is our school field day .
i often run into her at the supermarket .
take the battery off the machine .
might i ask your age ?
he is now in a very difficult situation .
he is absorbed in his work .
up against the wall !
my opinion is different from yours .
let 's speak english .
looking for his house , i walked about for over an hour .
you can 't just do one thing at a time .
i found it difficult to understand what he was saying .
he is sincere about what he says .
last night he came to the party with jane .
he never fails to do what he says .
i want to see it for myself .
i have heard the story .
it may snow in the evening .
he believed in the truth .
of the two girls , she is the younger .
he seems satisfied with my explanation .
she regarded the story as a joke .
he is mary 's brother , i should think .
i looked into the next room .
you are to start at once .
what size do you think i take ?
we had a very good time last night .
were all the members present at the meeting ?
she spoke for the homeless .
please let me drive your new toyota .
i can 't find my bag .
i looked for the key .
we went to the park , and we played there .
i haven 't seen her since last month .
the girl resembles her mother .
i 'm anxious for a promotion .
i made this kennel by myself .
he often goes to the movies together with her .
yumi speaks english very well .
you can go to the ballpark on this bus .
eat whatever food you like .
he made her his wife .
he will come all right .
it was not difficult to pretend to be my mother .
i speak japanese , english , and french .
tom came home early yesterday .
we 'll go along with your suggestion .
i left early so i could get a good seat .
life is all in all .
here 's some water .
i wonder what 's on her mind .
my friend has a large family .
i haven 't met him .
we will start when he comes .
i hear that you are a good tennis player .
a lot of students are present at the meeting .
this dress creases easily .
japan , for the most part , is a lovely place to live in .
you may have a slight fever .
they live in a sunny house .
he has made me what i am .
what would you do , if you were in my place ?
she was only too glad to help us .
he married a girl of his own choice .
it is the factory , my brother works in .
a gentleman would not say such a thing .
bring me today 's paper .
the reason she killed herself is unknown .
i find a good rival in him .
explain to him the difficult situation you are in .
i 'll have her call you when she gets back .
we are in for rain .
does the medicine act quickly ?
no one will speak for you .
my watch loses two minutes a day .
have you finished doing your homework yet ?
his efforts come to nothing .
can you spare me a few minutes of your time ?
who is the manager of that baseball team ?
he is uncertain about his future .
he had an accident on his way home .
i am interested in mountain climbing .
i finished the work for myself .
give me some more tea .
it 's rather cold today .
our baseball team is very strong .
he is not very fast at making friends .
don 't tell on me .
she didn 't come after all .
is there anything wrong with you ?
my mother does not speak english .
i think that they will be late .
the rumor turned out to be true .
do you still get in touch with them ?
why did you use up all the money ?
who told you the news ?
i was able to catch the last train .
my room is very small .
i met again the girl who i had met in the park the other day .
this road leads to the airport .
either you or i am in the wrong .
my brother goes to college in kobe .
he is about to leave for london .
the boy observed the birds all day .
she asked after her friend .
they closed the shop at five .
you should always be careful in your speech .
tears came to her eyes .
don 't answer your mother back .
there isn 't anyone in the room .
turn off the light , please .
that 's right , isn 't it ?
she has a large office in this building .
a clock has two hands .
did you hear of him ?
she asked me if i would be free next sunday .
i think his life is in danger .
you look pale . what 's the matter with you ?
read such a book as will be useful to you .
he was amazed at the news .
she has flowers in her hand .
it is yet to be seen whether this plan will succeed or not .
she is not playing straight .
she is more famous than you .
he achieved great success in life .
the bus left five minutes ahead of time .
homework must be done by tomorrow .
does that include breakfast ?
i adore going to the cinema .
he drank of the spring .
he does not like tennis .
he held out his hand .
he is trusted by his parents .
he was robbed when coming home late at night .
i listened to her story .
it rained for several days on end .
we looked , but saw nothing .
the post office is just across from the bank .
i will answer for his honesty .
my labor has started .
thank you for your patience .
have him wait a moment .
i don 't go in for that sort of thing .
i got my hair cut .
the japanese yen was appreciated .
look at that pretty little girl .
he is in want of money .
we hurried for fear we should be late for school .
my mother is not accustomed to hard work .
he robbed me of my new watch .
she kept her eyes off .
they were on board the same airplane .
she opens the window .
the cost of living in japan is going down .
she went on talking to her friend even after the class began .
no book is worth reading .
in the first place , we must be careful about what we eat and drink .
whichever you take , you will like it .
i still have a lot of work to do .
nobody likes to be made fun of in public .
you ought not to say such things in public .
the dress comes to my knees .
he prays several times a day .
the train was almost an hour behind time .
lucy and i have as many friends .
you want to leave it like that ?
why are you crying ?
will you make coffee for me ?
he 's inviting nothing but trouble .
we go to school by bus .
don 't stay up late every night .
he became the company president when he was thirty .
he always works hard .
the boy turned out to be clever .
she looked like a daughter of a good family .
i bought this watch at the store .
my older brother is a teacher .
please wait till i have finished my coffee .
he died yesterday .
we need to communicate with each other .
when will the concert be held ?
i 'm twice your age .
my watch loses three minutes a day .
i am looking for a present for my mother .
his hair stood on end .
is it getting worse ?
she turned pale at the news .
it happened one night .
don 't change the subject .
she is a doctor .
there is no room for doubt .
the game will be called off if it rains tomorrow .
never put off to tomorrow what you can do today .
i met her in the store by accident .
the birds are singing in the trees .
it is you that are responsible for the accident .
i met my classmate .
hang in there , and you can do it .
more often than not , he is late for school .
the train just left .
can you get it repaired ?
can you stand on your hands ?
this door is locked .
i ran into an old friend at tokyo station .
please tell me your name and telephone number .
i don 't doubt but that he will do it .
i would like you to make tea for me .
there may be some scars .
the children whirled about the garden .
here we are !
he comes here once a month .
she keeps her diary in english .
there is a house on the hill .
i live in the country .
he never tells a lie .
what put such an idea into your head ?
having walked for sometime , we came to the lake .
this is the last game .
the letter will arrive in a week or so .
do you not play tennis ?
i was amused at the story .
i 'm sorry , but he is out now .
let 's have a talk over a couple of drinks .
where did you buy the shoes ?
do you have to make dinner ?
i have been a lover of sports since i was young .
i went there to meet him .
don 't cut the cake with a knife .
they have four classes in the morning .
show him in .
happy birthday to you !
i wish there was more variety in my work .
are you going away this summer ?
he is off work for a few days .
won 't you have some fruit ?
he said so to her face .
the doctor has saved my life .
there isn 't anybody else .
mary or you are to go .
where are you going to spend the vacation ?
he hesitated for a moment .
if you have any questions , please let me know .
that he was busy is true .
i like summer best because i can swim .
can you make yourself understood in english ?
please call me up later .
this is an interesting story .
what time do you go to bed ?
tomorrow it might be me .
he is familiar with the subject .
she sat surrounded by her children .
the dog looked into the water .
may i ask you a question ?
he lives in osaka .
do you have adequate money for the trip ?
do you sometimes give your sister money ?
to change the subject .
which way shall we go now ?
i wish to go to hawaii .
you had better not go out in this bad weather .
it 's the front gate .
don 't worry about the work .
down came the rain in torrents .
i got a new hat at the shop .
be sure to drop us a line as soon as you get to london .
my sister can swim very fast .
what he says is true to some extent .
i like to sing songs .
we were greatly amused by her story .
his idea is far from satisfactory to us .
you may catch him , if you call at his office before eight .
you are quite in the wrong .
you were shouting at her and i don 't like that .
we must provide for the future .
would you move your car , please ?
the boy began to cry .
has father come home yet ?
his remark seems to be off the point .
ann is a little girl .
he is of a good line .
everything happened all at once .
you don 't need to go in such a hurry .
i believe she is a charming girl .
the man who is waving to me is my uncle .
he bought a dress for her .
do your homework for yourself .
i have met her before .
it is not possible to do if there is not every motivation .
our house was broken into by burglars last night .
reading affords us pleasure .
the more careful you are , the fewer mistakes you make .
so you 've got to be a believer .
i consider him to be an excellent teacher .
i 'll be glad to help him .
you may go anywhere .
we cannot meet your needs .
are you going to learn english ?
what does this word mean ?
do you remember me ?
pass the buck .
how long it is !
she is an earnest student .
i figure that she will succeed in her business .
i 'd like a book .
our vacation will soon come to an end .
they followed hard after the man .
no , i did it on my own account .
these things always happen in threes .
where did you get to know her ?
i am a poor correspondent .
she is an american by birth .
please choose between this one and that one .
that 's absolutely right .
i have a pricking pain here .
the writer is well known to us .
he is said to be a genius .
he knows whatever .
he was knocked over by the car .
he will object to your going abroad .
few people live to be ninety years old .
a very bright idea came to my mind .
in brief , i need money . please lend it to me !
the reason for your failure is that you did not try hard enough .
excuse me . may i get through ?
your account is empty .
he was at the bottom of the class .
he walked two miles in half an hour .
they are in favor of your plan .
he isn 't as honest as all that .
tomorrow is another day .
his eyes are set .
i will study abroad when i have finished school .
whatever she says is true .
i lost my watch .
do you like french literature ?
he cannot be an artist .
we should wait here for the moment .
these are my shoes and those are yours .
i would like to tell you something .
my camera is the same as your camera .
that just doesn 't make sense to me .
i found him at his books .
i 'm of the opinion that he should apologize to his teacher .
what kind of test is that ?
she did not come for a certain reason .
the sky is full of stars .
he is a good loser .
it 's my custom to go for a walk before breakfast .
she easily catches cold .
she has faults , too .
japanese houses are small .
don 't give up if you fail .
i agree with you .
you must not go up the stairs .
he read a most interesting novel yesterday .
she will get well soon .
the rain kept us from going out .
his proposal counted for nothing .
she caught me by the arm .
i thought that he was angry .
living on a small income is hard .
what animal is it ?
i have my passport .
we are anxious for your help .
he makes it a rule to go to bed at eleven o 'clock .
i don 't like apples .
she began to talk to the dog .
it is rare for him to get angry .
please refrain from smoking here .
he was born rich .
he can 't speak english , can he ?
we have a lot of work to do .
she cannot control her children .
i feel my age .
he caught hold of my hand .
we had a lot of thunder that summer .
i arrived just in time for the plane .
stay away from the fire .
i do love you .
what does she do in the evening ?
he went abroad .
what subjects are you taking at school ?
she is on the wrong side of twenty .
their plan resulted in failure .
he is as great a scientist as ever lived .
how tall you are !
we are dependent on each other .
please book a room for her .
i put up a notice .
yesterday i was caught in a shower on my way home from school .
i was crowded out .
i 'm not too clear about that point .
strange as it is , the story is true .
he 's a strange character .
let 's hit the hay .
this train runs between tokyo and osaka .
she came out with some strange tunings .
father is in the habit of reading the paper before breakfast .
please take care of yourself .
i will find you a good doctor .
winter is approaching .
let 's make believe we have one million yen hand .
i fall behind him in this respect .
there is a cat under the bed .
the boy must have broken the window .
go and see the doctor .
i could not make myself heard in the noisy class .
let me give you a bit of advice .
it will be a good lesson to him .
he can 't tell right from wrong .
the day when we arrived was a holiday .
by god , i 'll finish this homework .
you 're looking very well .
it may well rain before tonight .
i can 't figure out why she didn 't come .
this is the last food there is on this boat .
i haven 't seen him lately .
i 'd like some shoes .
only a few students understood the matter .
she wrote a book about the bird .
he didn 't hesitate to tell his wife the truth .
i don 't like him because he loses his temper easily .
she put the money in the bank .
of course , you may .
the appointed day is close at hand .
my parents approved of my marrying mary .
he is master of this house .
he got across the river .
once in a while he tells strange things .
i 'm fed up with english .
i got up at seven this morning .
he is a gentleman .
where will you go for the vacation ?
it is not a matter to laugh about .
do you agree to our proposal ?
the boy became happy .
may i speak with you ?
when is he expected back ?
i feel like doing something different today .
what if i fail ?
they are very big .
the game exhausted me .
send her in , and i will see her now .
i can no longer stand the cold .
will you go to the party instead of me ?
i stopped smoking for the sake of my health .
quiet down , please .
you must not eat too much .
you should consider the problem .
it was a pleasure to meet you .
the tree fell down .
i did not watch tv but studied english last night .
what 's this ?
there must be something wrong with the machine .
i think him a good teacher .
what do they call their baby ?
let 's get started right away .
i respect those who always do their best .
she is herself again .
tell us what to do next .
a book is lying on the desk .
he was running and calling for help .
i walked three-fourths of a mile .
to tell the truth , we got married last year .
let us go home .
they all looked up to him as their leader .
this is the most difficult book i have ever read .
in a way , you 're wrong .
look out of the window .
they are anxious for your help .
i had no idea who she was .
the meeting broke up at eight .
jealousy made him do that .
he made a fool of his teacher .
my sister is always in such a hurry that she often leaves things behind .
i 'm afraid there isn 't any coffee left .
i was late because of heavy traffic .
he is not the cheerful man he was .
all the students come from the us .
look into the matter more carefully .
my father is always getting angry .
i paid him a visit yesterday .
i admit my mistake .
i stayed with my uncle .
do you have any bags to check ?
people from the east do not look at things the same as we do .
it is really quite a good story .
he has pains in his side .
i am unconcerned with the problem .
japan has a lot of beautiful mountains .
give me a lift in your car .
every house had a garden .
it 's the same for everyone .
to speak a foreign language well takes time .
there is no telling what time he will come .
what shall i do with it ?
i 'm freezing .
he is a hard man to deal with .
there was once a time when i could not trust others .
sorry to impose , but would you please open the window ?
it appeared a true story .
mary prided herself on her beauty .
now and then she plays tennis .
he may have seen it .
how i wish i had a car .
mary was so kind as to help me .
we arrived on the morning of the seventh .
she lives quite close by .
i don 't believe him any longer .
i like neither of them .
there are many books in my room .
i don 't know what to do .
when does tony study ?
i will make you happy .
she accompanied me on the piano .
he kept his hat on .
she is good-natured .
what he said is still dark .
there is a cat under the desk .
he stood up with his hat in his hand .
you have made a promise .
where is my seat ?
he is eating .
his old car don 't get a cent .
my father was always missing buses .
my brother caught a big fish .
such a thing can 't happen in japan .
my wife is chinese .
it is ten years since i came to live here .
i got lost in the snow .
he is as gentle a person as ever lived .
she could not refrain from tears .
she studies as hard as any student in her class .
my opinion is similar to yours .
that was a close shave .
he is deservedly popular .
why don 't i try to do something about the garden ?
he took up golf this spring .
we 'll cross the river in a boat .
they made me go there alone .
may i borrow your dictionary ?
for example , do you like english ?
he is about my age .
they 're going to have a party next week .
it was so hot i took my coat off .
take whichever you like best .
the garden was filled with flowers .
i tried to ask her a riddle .
once a man , twice a child .
when did you get to know the fact ?
i don 't , either .
i do not read his novels .
he went out of his way to find the house for me .
he painted a picture of a dog .
he has much economic knowledge .
that cannot have been true .
i don 't want any sandwiches .
will you have dinner with me ?
it 's all the same to me .
he has always been at the head of the class .
i studied hard so that i could pass the examination .
how well she is singing !
i feel a little bad today .
i have just been to the station to see my uncle off .
it has been ten years since i came here .
call her up at three .
his opinion is quite different from ours .
my father fell ill because he worked too hard .
my cat and dog get along .
i 'm sorry i can 't swear by him .
don 't approach the dog .
it seems that we have lost our way .
this tree is the same age as that one .
i hope you 'll like it .
it 's about time to go to school .
mary likes watching tv .
she came across the street .
he was absent from school because of illness .
in japan we have a lot of rain in june .
there was no one about .
he tried hard in vain .
the fact is that he slept late that morning .
my plan is to study in australia .
be sure to take a note of what she says .
tom can speak german as well as english .
the party was , on the whole , successful .
this hotel does not take dogs .
george married my sister .
he speaks english and french .
it was a mistake on their part .
he asked her where her mother was .
there is no denying the fact .
shine your shoes before going out .
he was asked to give her some money .
we spoke what we know .
when she was reading the letter , she looked sad .
i bought a good camera .
don 't think i 'm made of money .
i cannot agree with you on this .
we are not here for fun and games .
he is right in a sense .
tonight i 've got to do get ready for tomorrow .
i will look the other way .
they regarded him as the best doctor in town .
let me think for a minute .
the doctor told him to cut down on smoking .
he has always devoted himself to music .
i had a bad cold for a week .
he is swimming in the pool .
you need not have hurried .
she was told to accompany me .
we could not open the box anyhow .
get me up at eight .
all you have to do is to work harder .
this plan is being discussed right now .
don 't make the same mistake again .
ten to one it 'll clear up in an hour or so .
we entered the room by the back door .
please turn on the light .
do you often hear from him ?
i have a family .
this pair of shoes doesn 't fit me .
the train arrived in kyoto on time .
please permit me to ask you some questions .
hurry , help .
he went fishing in a river near the village .
all the buses are full .
i had a time playing tennis .
the house is owned by him .
they meet once a week .
just the same !
he is far from being a gentleman .
scarcely had the dog seen me when it ran away .
his story turned out to be false .
be sure to drop in at my house .
she is expecting a child .
i 'm afraid she may have the mumps .
he fixed the broken table .
who is the girl in this picture ?
whatever you may say , i won 't give it up .
he got used to the work .
could you ring up these books for me ?
i haven 't met him properly yet .
we are afraid .
it looks like tom won the race .
which is the more expensive of the two ?
don 't be so reserved .
he got the ball .
i wonder why he is late .
send for the doctor .
do you want anything ?
i 'll look forward to it .

write down the name in case you forget it .
a man cannot be made in a mold .

he is always full of ideas .
i saw the man enter the room .
she came back before eight .
she came to see me .
i got home at seven .
she is a very intelligent young lady .
it has resulted in nothing .
i don 't even know who has stolen what .
ask at the police station over there .
i met her along the way to school .
we are to eat at six .
if it rains , the game will be put off .
please take good care of yourself .
what is the good of doing it ?
from kate 's point of view , he works too much .
i fancied that i heard a noise .
you must not keep in touch with him .
let 's stay here tonight .
this morning it cleared up .
in my personal opinion i am against the plan .
given that this is true , what should we do ?
you shall not for nothing as long as i live .
your question is hard for me to answer .
a baby craves its mother 's milk .
enjoy life while you may .
they were for the most part young people .
is anything the matter with him ?
this is the first time i 've had seaweed .
please listen to me .
there was only one other person on the platform .

please take care not to break this vase .
don 't look into the box .
that company went bankrupt .
i 've never woken up this early .
what 's in the box ?
we made him go .
i was just thinking of a new job .
by all accounts , it is truth .
because the train did not wait for me .
nothing is more vivid than a picture .
its value had trebled .
it is strange that you should know that .
the same can be said of many other persons .
he turned traitor .
let 's go out before it gets hot .
i met her by chance .
you 'll find the shop between a bank and a school .
i was late for the appointment .
it is expensive to live in japan .
will you translate this into french ?
the pain was terrible .
i don 't feel like studying at all tonight .
all you have to do is to concentrate .
this is the book i 've been looking for .
i have nothing to do with him .
shall we stop in at a coffee shop ?
i got a lot of out of that book i read .
i arranged for a car to meet you at the airport .

we can but do our best .
i can 't stand to take another university entrance exam !
take it easy .
i am sure of success .
bill didn 't turn up at the party .
she did not so much as look at me .
that is why all the students in the class agreed with him .
it goes without saying that good health is more important than wealth .
the baby will be able to walk soon .
he has gone out for lunch already .
i remember hearing a very similar story to that .
i expect your help .
i am too ashamed to do it .
the situation in now getting unfavorable .
i want someone to talk to .
my wife is ignorant of the world .
she kept on writing stories about animals .

there is no telling what will happen next .
it all came to nothing .
anything new today ?

what 's the material ?
this school has many students .
it is useless to talk to him .
my family is small .
words failed me at the last minute .
this coat is rainproof .
she explained the matter to me .
would you like some more tea ?
he is free from pride .
i can 't trust in his word .
let 's take a chance and go for broke .
i 'm afraid it 's going to rain tomorrow .

i had a stillborn baby three years ago .
please leave some money .
this is what i can do for you .
how long do i have to wait for the next bus ?
i invited them to the party .
this watch keeps bad time .
he persists in his opinion .
we parted at the station at three .
it is fortunate that you have such parents .
nothing is missing .
i was very glad that she took the side of me .
such a thing cannot be found everywhere .
that is the exactly the same idea as i have .
she will come soon .
i saw him but once .
i gather that they 'll agree with us .
let 's get everything fixed here and now .
how is the weather today ?

it is preferable that she do it alone .
i have a cold .
the movie was less funny than the book .
her idea counts for little .
i ought to have made a hotel reservation earlier .
watch your language .

she was never free from pain after that .
let 's drink to his success .

may i use this pencil ?
we thought of him as a genius .
he can 't be ill .
he didn 't turn up after all .

he is far from a good tennis player .
we must not break our promise .
to my great sorrow , my father died young .
now eat your supper .
the plane is on the way from tokyo to italy .
the child was taken care of by him .
have you finished your english homework yet ?
he insulted me without reason .
young as he was , he was a man of ability .
you will write a letter .
i owe my success to him .
he is not tall any more than i am .
we arrived here in the evening .
what do you think about the book ?
i heard the boys singing .
i was looking at her .
i spoke to him on the phone last night .
i 'm going to carry out this plan .
owing to a bad cold , he could not take part in the game .

we are keeping a big dog .
generally speaking , what she says is right .
as many men as came were welcomed .
come here soon .

you will soon be able to speak english .
i got my hair cut .
night coming on , we went home .

the door remained closed before her .
her composition was free from mistakes .
the train arrived safely at the station a few minutes ago .
what ails you ?
i am of the opinion that he will never come back .

if you are to win , you should do your best .
let 's find something to sit on .
much to my disappointment , she did not come .
she likes to go walking by herself .
i bought this yesterday .
they sat down at every other desk .
i 've got to see a dentist .
i 'm very grateful for your help .
never play here .
it will be fine tomorrow .
we spoke to no purpose .
the baseball game was canceled because of the heavy rain .
he is always true to his friends .
she is almost as tall as you .
make one 's hair stand on end .
could you make it another time ?
she looks lonesome .
it is necessary for you to go there .
could you send it to this address ?
you say you changed schools .
that 's tom 's house with the red roof .
look at the picture on the wall .
they left there the day before yesterday .
i hope he will get through the exam .
the garden is in front of the house .
