you are the only one .
i stick to the point .
i 'll be here by monday .
she is the happiest in her class .
how beautiful the rising sun is !
nothing is so precious as time .
you did not need to come so early .
i had some questions and raised my hand .
she expressed satisfaction with her life .
it was around eight last night when the meeting broke up .
the life of a person is a transient thing .
don 't raise my hopes like that .
they won by force of numbers .
i was eating dinner then .
it 's hot today .
he is a detective .
he always takes sides with her .
jane always made out that she was very rich .
what a bad boy he is !
he is what we call the man of the hour .
in fact , he is a nice fellow .
where does the answer lie ?
you may as well prepare for your examination .
i can 't see well .
can we rent a car ?
a wise man would not say such a thing .
he told me that she was sick .
there was nobody in the garden .
our college is far from the station .
he had been writing a letter .
he spoke to her about the matter .
let me see it .
he sat there with his eyes closed .
you should work hard while you are young .
he made an abrupt departure .
this is how the accident happened .
jane was a stewardess when she was young .
he was afraid of his wife .
how far is it to the station ?
he is as diligent a man as ever lived .

there are more girls than boys in our school .
the days are getting longer and longer .
lay it on the table .
what are you going to do today ?
it rained hard last night .
how about going to the movies tonight ?
you have no obligation to help us .
of course , i will go there with you .
they slept a little in the room .
speak your mind .
the old man died last week .
i was astonished to hear what had happened .
his hands had turned blue because of the cold .
i couldn 't make her out at all .
it is outside my area of study .
it was careless of you to forget your homework .
there is a park in front of my house .
i 'm not tired at all .
it makes no difference who i meet .
jane is no less beautiful than her mother .
what on earth is the matter ?
i 'd like to go skiing with her .
the mystery story is so hard that i don 't like it .
her teacher praised her .
here is a letter for you .
the meaning of the words is intelligible .
speaking of sports , can you play tennis ?
it 's already cleared up .
i get up at six every morning .
the bank was held up last night .
i want to marry a girl like her .
he told us to keep quiet .
he is as great a statesman as ever lived .
are you proud of your father ?
computers can do the job with ease .
this case has an affinity with that one .
there 's an old cherry tree in the garden .
i do not like cats and my brother does not either .
my brother has no occupation now .
he did not so much as turn his head .
he got off at the next bus stop .
there is no telling who did this .
she showed me her room .
he asked me which way to go .
she is anxious to know the results .
there are all kinds of flowers in that garden .
he had a blue jacket on .
no one is coming .
he has a warm heart .
she recollected the first day when she went to school .
please take more care in the future .
i had a lot of difficulty getting in touch with her .
the policeman 's quick arrival surprised us .
get in touch with me as soon as you arrive here .
it is fact that he ran away from home .
the news made her very sad .
thank you very much for the wonderful dinner last night .
i was ten minutes late for school .
how 's the weather ?
she worked to excess .
father took his place at the head of the table .
he is still alive .
my father put a ladder against the tree .
would you please open the door ?
i am to have lunch with him .
we need some money .
i walk to the park .
just wait for me there .
where 's your better half ?
he is likely to win this game .
i wonder if someone could help me do this .
there are many movie theaters in this city .
let 's meet here again tomorrow .
unless it rains , i will go , too .
i love this job from the bottom of my heart .
i 've never been to such a nice party .
they booted him out of school for not studying .
i 'll give you a call before i visit you .
his story rings true .
he left a while ago .
what does this kanji mean ?
it is necessary for you to go there immediately .
my son shall do the work .
i 'd like to have a glass of wine .

i ran out of breath .
i don 't care too much for hot food .
we have to start at once .
i am just a nobody .
this question isn 't easy .
may i go home now ?
i like both .
they sat under a tree .
i got some sand in my eye .
the old man stopped for a moment to rest .
how many times a month do you write home ?
tony was not busy then .
all sold out !
we 'll fly there in 50 minutes .
she keeps company with a foreign student .
yesterday i ran across her at the station .
we should be there by noon .
it was colder yesterday than today .
you made the same mistake as last time .
my uncle bought me this book .
being tired , she went to bed early .
the weather is unusual today .
he is being very careful .
it is hard for an old man to change his way of thinking .
you had better go to bed early .
he was injured in the accident .
well do i remember the man 's name .
at last , they came to a decision .
he is on the team .
why don 't you give up smoking ?
they were the first to get into the bus .
it 's a pity that you should leave japan .
that is surprising .
we came to the town , where we stayed for a week .
please leave my things alone .
but you will write , won 't you ?
it is still immoral .
i 'd like some more butter .
that boy is tony , isn 't he ?
i like summer the best .

how did the accident come about ?
what time do you leave here ?
mary became a typist .
my father boasts of the fact that he has never had a traffic accident .
he acquainted me with the change of the plan .
sit down with me .
please send the letter by express .
this is an important letter .
take as many as you want .
his novels are too deep for me .
he relies on his wife financially .
you are old enough to be independent of your parents .
we walked to the river .
i made him change his plan .

if it rains tomorrow , will you stay at home ?
do you have a student fare ?
let 's have dinner .
if something happens , feel free to call me .
you need not take the trouble to go .
in any case , it 's none of your business .
three years is a long time , i feel .
would you put on the air conditioning ?
i didn 't want to be defeated in front of my friends .
as soon as you get the wall painted , you can go home .
i 'm very sleepy now .
above the music , i could hear her crying .
we had the meeting in this room last friday .
who do you want to speak to ?
his father eats there twice a week .
he was terribly poor when he was young .
you may open the window .
driving too fast is dangerous .
i play with him .
i am a man .
what 's the purpose of your visit ?
please tell me where the bus stop is .
if you must , you must .
i haven 't made up my mind sufficiently enough to agree with you .
